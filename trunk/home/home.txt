==A Variety of Public Offerings From One Guy Group, Inc.==

_"Users of commercial software who immediately upgrade to newer versions of an application expect to find improvements. Instead, they often find useful features removed, new or unfixed bugs, reduced performance, or non-productive changes to the user interface. These users have no recourse, since many of these niche applications are available from only one or two large companies...until now."_

===Who am I?===

I'm a C++ programmer named [http://vinniefalco.com Vinnie Falco]. You can visit my [http://vinniefalco.com personal website] to learn more about me.

===Who are we?===

We are a collection of individuals and corporations who embrace the !OneGuy™ principles, to form a network of creative minds who add to the collective knowledge and art of society through public domain contributions, in a manner compatible with commercial success (making money).

===What is a !OneGuy™?===

A !OneGuy™:

  * Places human need above profit.
  * Contributes to the public domain.
  * Enhances the world by empowering people.

===Free?===

Yes, free. !OneGuy™ offerings come with little to no restrictions. However, contributors sometimes require that paid licenses for their professional products (hosted elsewhere) be purchased when someone utilizes the software or content in a commercial setting (making money).
